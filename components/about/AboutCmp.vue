    <div class="title">Data is humanityâ€™s most powerful resource.</div>
    <div>
      Most of the problems we face on the internet can be traced back to the
      exchange of data.
    </div>
    <div>
      Lack of privacy, censorship, digital nudging, invasive ads, and much more.
      But limiting it is just a bandaid that results in a worse internet for
      all.
    </div>
    <div>
      At TIKI, we build better ways to exchange data. Or, as we like to say,
      "unfuck the internet."
    </div>
    <div>
      We enable willing and informed (fair market value) people and businesses
      to trade with one another.
    </div>
    <div>
      Powered by TIKI's decentralized exchange and built on blockchain
      technology, our tools (SDKs, APIs, and Apps) bring data trade to existing
      systems.
    </div>
    <div>
      Data rewards, loyalty, gated features, managed consent, pooling, and more.

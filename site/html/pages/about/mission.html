  <p class="my-4">We're building TIKI for people <b>and</b> businesses to feel good about the flow of data on the internet.</p>
  <p class="my-4">Historically, data moved freely without repercussion for misuse ‚Äîthat went poorly. In reaction, the new norm is to limit, or in many cases shut-off, the flow of data ‚Äîan equally bad outcome.</p>
  <p class="my-4">We think there's a better approach, one that's not so binary ‚Äî<b>fair, transparent, data trade</b>. Enforceable rights, licensing, compensation, the basic essentials we expect for any valued asset. It's time we apply it to data.</p>
  <p class="my-4">So, here's to unlocking the true potential of our data üçπ.</p>

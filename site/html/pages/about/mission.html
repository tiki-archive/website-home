        Historically, data moved freely without repercussion for misuse ‚Äîthat
        went poorly. In reaction, the new norm is to limit, or in many cases
        shut-off, the flow of data ‚Äîan equally bad outcome.

      <p class="mt-5">
        We think there's a better approach, one that's not so binary ‚Äî<b>
          fair, transparent, data trade
        </b>
        . Enforceable rights, licensing, compensation, the basic essentials we
        expect for any valued asset. It's time we apply it to data.

        So, here's to unlocking the true potential of our data üçπ.

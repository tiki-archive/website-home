# TIKI DX (Developer Experience)
An amalgamation of code and projects designed to improve a developer's experience with TIKI. It's the sort of stuff that powers the [mytiki.com](https://mytiki.com) website, sample code, and our reference docs. 

## Project Structure
- `/api`: API router and raw OAS3 files
- `/examples`: Code samples and popular integrations
- `/infra`: Infrastructure as code —org-wide infra scripts
- `/mytiki`: Content and assets for the mytiki.com website
- `/quickstart`: Sandboxed projects for TIKI's quickstart guides
